In current version the Skrew Connectors and the clip hooks of the cover are improved. Rounded edges gives more stability.
Printed good on an Ender 3 V2. 
Any critic, improvement suggestion is welcome. This is my second freecad work, would apreciate to get more input from you.

At this point many thanks to flowwies channel!
